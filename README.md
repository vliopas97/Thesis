  # Mixed Reality System for generating procedural 3D content
  
  The procedural generation of virtual scenes for use in virtual reality applications
  is not something new since it has been the subject of various studies and experimentation
  for over two decades.
  
  However most of the work performed in this field is depended on the knowledge of predetermined data,
  demanding that the physical environment is either known or pre-scanned and then 
  they proceed to render the corresponding virtual scene.
  
  The possibility of procedurally generating virtual scenes in previously unseen environments
  that are being analyzed on the fly, is the next step to be taken and opens new paths regarding
  the development of VR applications focusing in full body room-scale locomotion techniques
  owing to the fact that not only they do not demand prior knowledge of the physical environment
  but because, in theory, they allow complete freedom of movement in space without the need 
  of defining a `play area'.
  
  The goal of this study is exactly that: the implementation of a VR application capable of scanning
  and analyzing the available physical space and adapt to it by providing a corresponding
  digital scene, in real time, ensuring the safe and unrestrained movement of the player in space.
